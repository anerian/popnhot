Sheriff's Department custody Friday for <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/kim-kardashian-sister-khloe-is-ready-to-go-to-jail-over-dui" target="_blank">violating probation following a 2007 DUI arrest</a>, the department confirmed to <b>Usmagazine.com</b>.</p>
<p>Khloe was dropped off at the Van Nuys Courthouse, according to the department.  Friday was the deadline for her sentence to begin.</p>
<p>Khloe partied with sister Kim and brother Robert Jr. at Matt Leinart's Celebrity Bowling Night at Lucky Strike Lanes in Hollywood Thursday night.</p>
<p>"She's not nervous now, but I think she will be tomorrow," Kim told <b>Jimmy Kimmel</b> on Thursday.</p>
<p>"She definitely has to live up to what she's done and take responsibility, and she's willing to do that. I think she just wants it over with," she added. "Khloe is the tough one."</p>
<p>She's "ready and willing" to head to jail, Kim wrote on her blog Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is unclear how long she will be behind bars (she could stay up to 30 days). Kim, 27, says "no matter how long and where," Khloe, 23, just wants to "have this resolved."</p>
<p>Khloe will also have to enroll in an alcohol treatment program — one of the terms of probation she failed to complete — within three weeks of her release.</p>

    ]]></summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/federline-spears-p_0.jpg" align="left" /><p><b>Kevin Federline</b> is "absolutely delighted" his <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celeb-divorces" target="_blank">ongoing custody battle</a> with <b>Britney Spears</b> has ended, his lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan says.</p>
<p>It has been reported that <b>Britney Spears</b> has agreed to give <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/britney-spears-gives-kevin-federline-sole-custody-of-boys" target="_blank">Federline, 30, sole custody</a> of their boys Sean Preston, 2 1/2, and Jayden, 1 1/2.</p>
<p>"Nobody could have anticipated the terms of events that have occurred," Kaplan tells <a href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b147009_britney_agrees_sole_custody_k-fed.html" target="_blank">E!</a>. "This was a two-year journey that will be halted at a point that is good for these children.</p>
<p>"Kevin's [goal] was not to get custody," Kaplan adds. "Kevin's goal was to set up some kind of template so the mother of his children can co-parent."</p>
<p>Spears, 26, currently has monitored, twice-a-week visitation and one overnight visitation per week. Under the settlement, Spears will get more time with her kids, her attorney, Laura Wasser said.</p>
<p>Federline is due at court today; the court has yet to approve the settlement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/timeline_britneys_trip_to_the_hospital" target="_blank">Spears lost visitation rights in January after she was hospitalized</a> at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Since then, she has been under the co-conservatorship of <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/britney_and_her_parents_through_the_years_020608" target="_blank">her father, Jamie</a>. (A hearing is set for July 31 to determine if the co-conservatorship will be extended.)</p>
<p>"While I can't tell you the terms of the [settlement], it does anticipate what happens if the conservatorship is extended," Kaplan says. "Devil is always in the details and this is a very detailed deal memo.</p>
<p>Adds Kaplan, "Nobody can predict what the future will bring but to the extent possible, I think we have really anticipated how to proceed."</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/wilson-stiller-p.jpg" align="left" /><p><i>Tropic Thunder</i> director and star <b>Ben Stiller</b> has opened up about pal <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/owen_wilson_myspace_video" target="_blank">Owen Wilson's suicide attempt</a> last August.</p>
<p>"It's impossible to understand that kind of pain – depression or anything like that – until you're in it," Stiller tells <i>Playboy</i> in the August issue of the magazine.</p>
<p>"I love Owen," he says of his <I>Royal Tenenbaums</i> co-star. "I felt bad that he had to deal with all the outside bulls--t."</p>
<p>(<b>Matthew McConaughey</b> replaced Wilson in <i>Tropic Thunder</i>.)</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/Bromances-0708" target="_blank">See photos of other Hollywood Bromances</a>.)</p>
<p>Stiller, 42, also reveals that he was "blown away" by <i>Tropic Thunder</i> co-star <b>Robert Downey Jr.</b></p>
<p>"I started trying to copy him," the comic says. "It was like, 'Wow, this guy's a genius; maybe if I do what he does, I'll be a genius too!'"</p>
<p>Stiller jokes: "If he had spun around and thrown oat bran at the moon, I'd have run out, bought some oat bran and started spinning. I want to look like I'm as big a genius as he is."</p>
<p><b>Tom Cruise</b>'s anticipated role as a studio chief – for which he wore a fat suit – in <i>Tropic Thunder</i> was his own idea, Stiller says.  </p>
<p>"It wasn't even in the script," Stiller says. "I didn't have to persuade him."</p>
<p>The actor tells <i>Playboy</i> that "people would rather dwell on somebody else's problems than look at their own" – and revealed he's just like <i>Us</i>!</p>
<p>"Do I want to pick up a copy of <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> or grab <i>Us Weekly</i>?" he asks. "If I'm in a checkout line, I'll take the one with the big pictures."</p>
<p>So is there a line of humiliation that the jokester won't consider?</p>
<p>"I think I'd draw the line at porn, but no one has asked," Stiller tells <I>Playboy</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tropic Thunder</i> opens August 13.</p>

<p>"We are sad to announce the engagement of Salma Hayek and Francois-Henri Pinault has been canceled," Hayek's rep said in a statement to <a href=" http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-17-salma-hayek_N.htm" target="_blank"><i>USA Today</i></a>.  "There will be no further comment."</p>

<p>Hayek, 41, told the April issue of <i>Glamour</i> that she didn't feel the "need" to get married.</p>
<p>"Do I think we are going to get married? Probably. Will it make a difference? I hope not," she said.</p>
<p>"You want to grow old with someone, you want to have a partner and to have children — we have all those things," Hayek added. "Some people need the commitment. Maybe we'll just make the party!"</p>

<p>The two kept their relationship low-key since meeting in Venice in May 2006.</p>
<p>They revealed they were expecting around the same time they announced their engagement last March.</p>
<p>Valentina was born last September.</p>
<p>Initially,  Hayek said she <a href=" http://www.usmagazine.com/Salma_hayek_i_wanted_to_have_a_boy" target="_blank"> "wanted a boy."</a></p>
<p>"Probably because I was afraid," she told <i>Glamour</i>. "I think women suffer a bit more than boys, and there is always conflict between mothers and daughters." </p>
<p>"Now that she's here, I'm so happy she's a girl," Hayek said. "And I can't imagine there ever being conflict between us, because I'm in a state of innocence where I love everything she does." </p>
<p>Valentina is the first child for Hayek; Pinault, 45, has two children from a previous marriage.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/garner-affleck-p.jpg" align="left" /><p><b>Jennifer Garner</b> and husband <b>Ben Affleck</b> are expecting another baby, Garner’s former <i>Alias</i> co-star <b>Victor Garber</b> confirms to <b>Usmagazine.com</b>. </p>
<p>"Yes, she is," Garber, who currently stars on ABC's <i>Eli Stone</i>, told <b>Us</b> in a taped interview when asked if recent speculation was true that the couple is expecting.</p>
<p>(Garber officiated the couple's 2005 wedding.)</p>
<p>A source adds, "She is five months pregnant. They are very happy."</p>
<p>Garner, 36, and Affleck, 35, are parents to two-year-old daughter Violet - one of Us' Babies of the Year. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/jennifer_and_violet_draft" target="_blank">"Honestly, that child is so inquisitive and so full of life</a>  — it’s all Jennifer and Ben!" Garber gushed to <b>Usmagazine.com</b> in November 2007. "I have to say, he’s an amazing dad and together, she’s a very fortunate little girl to be in that family!"</p>
<p>Garner hinted in October that she wanted to have another child.</p>
<p>"We definitely wonder what it would be like to have another - hopefully, knock on wood, someday," Garner told Britain's <i>Marie Claire</i>. "My job is great to have as a mom. I get to take breaks and then work in a really concentrated way. During that concentrated time, it sucks, but whatever."</p>
<p>Photos of Garner in loose fitting tops have had Web sites speculating about a bun in the oven for weeks.</p>

<p>When it comes to Violet, Garner has revealed she's a total daddy's girl.</p>
<p>"You know how as a kid you picture yourself with a tall, handsome husband, and you imagine him cuddling your baby?" Ben is like that, like, on crack," she told the May 2007 issue of <i>In Style</i>. "Violet prefers him to anyone. He's a teddy bear of a guy. Nothing makes me happier than to see the two of them together and her little hands on his face. He has a prevailing calm. Of course, he has the benefit of sleep."</p>
<p>Affleck recently opened up to <i>Access Hollywood</i>'s Billy Bush about his happy family life. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/ben-affleck-says-life-with-family-is-pretty-great" target="_blank">"Things couldn’t be better. </a> We’re kind of taking it easy and just kind of enjoying a little downtime at home," Affleck said.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/shonda-heigl-th.jpg" align="left" /><p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> star <b>Katherine Heigl</b>, 29, <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/katherine-heigl-drops-out-of-emmy-race" target="_blank"> withdrew herself from Emmy contention, </a>saying that she didn't feel she was "given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination-" but show creator <b>Shonda Rhimes</b> says there are no hard feelings.</p>
<p>"I didn't feel insulted," Rhimes told reporters Thursday during an ABC TCA panel in Los Angeles. "I have a wonderful working relationship with Katherine, and Izzy is one of my favorite characters. So, [when I heard her comment] it was surprising."</p>
<p>Rhimes added,"But Katie is an outspoken person and I think we all knew that already.</p>
<p>But according to a source, in response to Heigl’s griping, staffers are considering giving her character, Dr. Izzie Stevens, <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/katherine-heigls-greys-anatomy-character-could-be-killed-off" target="_blank">a fatal brain tumor.</a></p>
<p>“[Producer] Shonda [Rhimes] and the writers are pissed at her,” the source told the new issue of <b>Us Weekly</b>. “It’s their way of screwing with her. She  won’t know whether she’s going to live or die.”</p>
<p>Rhimes told reporters at TCA, "Storywise we have a really great story worked out that we're all very excited about. And things are going fine."</p>
<p>But <i>Ugly Betty</i> creator <b>Silvio Horta</b> has other ideas. </p>
<p>“I would have put her in a coma,” <i>Ugly Betty</i> creator <b>Silvio Horta</b> joked about reports that Heigl's will get a fatal brain tumor.</p>
<p>At Wednesday's Television Critics Association’s annual fall preview, ABC entertainment president Stephen McPherson insisted Heigl is "absolutely staying with the show. There's an unbelievable storyline this season."</p>
<p>The show returns September 25 with a two-hour premiere.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/mischa-th.jpg" align="left" /><p><b>Mischa Barton</b> has opened up about her December 2007 DUI arrest.</p>
<p>“That was a low point for me. I never, ever would have thought I would be arrested,”  Barton told <a href="http://www.nylonmag.com/?section=article&amp;parid=1706" target="_blank"><i>Nylon</i> </a>magazine's August issue. </p>
<p>“I was disappointed because it associated me with a group of girls that I would rather not be associated with.  That was the biggest bummer for me – I didn’t leave my house. I was too embarrassed. They made such a big deal out of it with these other young actresses, that, for a little bit, I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.”</p>
<p>In April the <i>OC</i> alum was put on <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/mischa-barton-pleads-guilty-to-DUI" target="_blank">three years' probation, ordered to attend a three-month alcohol education program and fined $1,652.</a> </p>

<p>"It was a stupid thing to do," Barton, who now lives in Paris said of driving under the influence. "But... I’ve done a lot to pay back for what I did."</p>
<p>The actress, 22, continued, “I make mistakes, and I never claimed to be perfect. It’s weird. The way I live my life, I don’t want to be so closeted that I just have to shut myself off and become some protected young starlet that’s removed from reality, but I was also just shocked at what a big deal people made out of it.”</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/Mischa_Barton_Turns_Down_Gossip_Girl_Role" target="_blank"><b>Usmagazine.com</b> previously reported,</a> Barton turned down a role on <i>Gossip Girl</i>.</p>
<p>“I was offered to play a role, but just because I’ve come out of ‘The OC,’ why would I want to go back on another series that is exactly the same?” she asked. “It’s just not what I wanted to do, and it’s not the kind of material I’m looking for.” </p>

<p>What's next for Barton?</p>
<p>"I would want to go to college for the learning, but there's so much else that comes with that that I don't think I need anymore," she said. "I've been making my own money and living as an adult for far too long.</p>
