    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/sjp-p.jpg" align="left" /><p><b>Matthew Broderick</b> admits that he and wife <b>Sarah Jessica Parker</b> (aka <a href=" http://www.usmagazine.com/satc-Carries-Crazy-Couture" target="_blank">"Carrie Bradshaw"</a>) still smoke – and he predicts it will rub off on their 5-year-old son, James<br />
Wilkie.</p>
<p>"[He's] already curious," Broderick told <a href=" http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/06/matthew_broderick_and_sarah_je_1.html" target="_blank"><i>New York</i></a>.</p>
<p>"I can just see the little budding gene of a smoker in there," Broderick said. "He'll see a cigarette butt and say, 'What is that? Why do people smoke?'"</p>
<p>As for his own smoking habit, Broderick revealed: "I used to smoke cigarettes, and I still do, lately. I gave that up a long time ago, but every now and then I will fall off for a week."</p>
<p><i>Sex and the City</i> star Parker is "worse than me on that," Broderick added.</p>
<p>Norman H. Edelman — chief medical officer with the American Lung Association — tells <b>Us</b>, "Children of smokers are much more likely to become smokers themselves," adding that more than 438,000 people die each year in the U.S. from smoking-related illnesses.</p>

<p>"What is the opposite of a belly laugh?" <A href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/movies/20guru.html" target="_blank"><i>New York Times</i></a> reviewer A.O. Scott wrote. "[It] is downright antifunny, an experience that makes you wonder if you will ever laugh again."</p>
<p>Scott said "unfunny" and "obnoxious" do "not quite capture the strenuous unpleasantness" of Myer's portrayal of the main character Guru Pitka.</p>

<p>But she did share how she and <b>Brad Pitt</b> are prepping for their twins.</p>
<p>"We've made a point to, both of us, not be working," she says. "So we'll be home together with the kids.</p>
<p>"At the same time we're expecting two, we have four, so my focus now is on the four we have," she says of daughter Shiloh, 2; Maddox, 6; Pax, 4; Zahara, 3.</p>
<p>"And these are some big times for them, big moments in their lives," she adds. "So every day is just about making sure that their schooling is going right and their manners are intact and we're disciplining properly and we're spending enough time with them individually, so they seem special. That's a lot of balance when you have a lot of children."</p>

<p>Pitt does his part as well.</p>
<p>"I'm very lucky — I'm with a man who makes me feel very sexy pregnant and loves children," Jolie says. "In the last few months it's hard for me to pick up the other kids, so he's there to help lift them up to me and things like that.</p>

<p>"He's an extremely hands-on dad with all the kids and really, really supportive," she adds. "Any woman knows that when you're pregnant, if you have a partner who is embracing it with you and excited with you, it makes all the difference. I'm very lucky to have him." </p>

<p>She was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. She must complete it within 12 months.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, her rep said, "One thing I would say about her is that she's incredibly hard working, and she's not scared of hard work. She can handle whatever she's asked to do.</p>
<p>"She is very, very relieved it is over and she has been treated fairly," the rep said. "The whole thing is regrettable, she knows that."</p>

<p>Campbell <a href=" http://www.usmagazine.com/naomi-campbell-charged-with-assaulting-police-officer" target="_blank">was arrested</a> in April aboard a British Airways flight when she threw a fit after her carry-on bags came up missing. She was removed from the plane and held for eight hours at the airport police station before being released.</p>
<p>Though a British Airways rep would not comment on the case, the spokesperson suggested that Campbell has been banned by the airline.</p>
<p>"We take all cases of disruptive behavior extremely seriously and take action where appropriate," the rep said in a statement. "We have banned people from traveling with us in the past, and we reserve the right to ban passengers."</p>
<p>Last year, Campbell was ordered to spend a week mopping floors at a NYC warehouse for assaulting her maid with a cell phone.</p>

<p>"[Maddie is] cute but nearly old-fashioned at this point," Satran says. "The nickname Maddie has been popular in its own right since the 1980s, when it was the name used by the character played by <b>Cybill Shepherd</b> in <i>Moonlighting</i>."</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/brit-lynne-p.jpg" align="left" /><p><b>Britney Spears</b> "intends to return to Louisiana," her mom <b>Lynne</b> says in a declaration to the L.A. Superior Court filed Tuesday obtained by <b>Usmagazine.com</b>.</p>
<p>"Britney has spent a majority of her time over the last five years in the state of California due in part to work but primarily with respect to a custody dispute currently ongoing," Lynne explains.</p>
<p>Britney's ex <b>Kevin Federline</b> has primary custody of their two young children, Jayden James and Sean Preston.</p>
<p>At Tuesday's hearing, the court commissioner granted Britney's father <b>Jamie</b> <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/britney-spears-to-join-pregnant-jamie-lynn-in-kentwood+" target="_blank">permission to sell the singer's six-bedroom home</a> in Beverly Hills, CA. (Because her father is her co-conservator, the decision to sell the home required a court's approval.)</p>

<p>Though she has spent most of her time in Beverly Hills, Britney has owned a home in their hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana for the past eight years.</p>
<p>Britney and Jamie flew to Kentwood Wednesday for the birth of Britney's younger sister <b>Jamie Lynn</b>'s baby, <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/why-jamie-lynn-spears-named-her-daughter-maddie-briann" target="_blank">Maddie Briann</a>, Thursday.</p>
