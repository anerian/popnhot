Here are a few of those adorable pics:</p>

Seriously, this baby is CUUUUUUTE!  I love the pics of <strong>Levi</strong> with <strong>Matthew</strong> in the hospital just after his birth &#8212; that little cap is to die for (I realize that all newborn babies get that same little cap but Levi is just rockin&#8217; it right).  I can really see how father and son may be pretty much inseparable from here on out.  <strong>Matthew</strong> looks pretty darn proud of his boy &#8230; and rightfully so, he&#8217;s just the cutest thing ever :)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Pink</em> reader <strong>Jess</strong> sends in a few pics from the <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://tour.nin.com"><em>Lights in the Sky</em> Tour</a> concert stop at the <strong>Rexall Place</strong> in Edmonton, Alberta in Canada that she attended with her fiancée this week:</p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_ninedmontontease.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="263" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3162" /><br />
After the jump, check out a few photos of the performance and a portion of her report from the show &#8230; <span id="more-3160"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_ninedmonton.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="1327" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3164" /><br />
<font color=white>Wow, wow, WOW! I bought my fiancée tickets to NIN&#8217;s Edmonton show, based on the fact that he has been a fan, like, forever, and had yet to see them. I knew a few songs, but not very many, so I wasn&#8217;t anticipating that I would have a fantastic time. Wow, was I wrong! This show was INCREDIBLE. Absolutely amazing. The lightshow, and screens, which made up 99% of the set, were simply awesome. I left the show a huge fan.  Lemme tell ya, you will NOT be disappointed!  We were just off of the floor (thankfully, as you will see, judging by photos, I don&#8217;t think my 3&#8242; heels would have fared well on the floor!)  Hope you enjoy!!</font></p>
<p>Wee!  I am so excited &#8230; much, much love to <strong>Jess</strong> for sending in her pics &#8212; and I&#8217;m happy to know that <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> made a new fan.  I am getting really geeked that I&#8217;ll be seeing <strong>NIN</strong> in just a few short weeks.  Thank you again for taking the time to share your pics and for sending in your fun report :)</p>
<p>[thanks <strong>Jessica</strong>]</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was a very fun &#8230; very long day.  Steph and I hopped a train and made our way to <a target="_blank" href="http://disneylandparis.com/">Disneyland Paris</a> (which is celebrating it&#8217;s 15th year anniversary this year) for a half-day at Le Royaume Magique.  Because David and Alek had a lot of work to do (and, more prolly cuz they didn&#8217;t wanna) they opted out of the <strong>Disney</strong> fun with us &#8230; nonetheless, we had a blast as these photos can attest:</p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_disneylandparis.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="2742" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3151" /><br />
Let me tell you &#8230; it was hot and humid but we still had a lot of fun.  I was very impressed with the park itself &#8230; <strong>Disneyland Paris</strong> has a bunch of really great attractions and a <strong>Space Mountain</strong> ride that beats the hell out of the original in Anaheim, CA.  Too much fun, let me tell you &#8230; we ended up staying a bit longer than we wanted to (the wait for <strong>Thunder Mountain</strong> was killer) but overall, it was a great success.  Because we were pretty much wiped the eff out afterwards, we all made it an early night in.  Steph cooked an amazing dinner to round out the night.  So much fun!!</p>
<p>Today is shopping day, so I&#8217;m looking forward to that ;)</p>
<p>Oh, and because it <em>is</em> after all &#8230;</p>
<p><center><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/JW1zO-FXiUU&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/JW1zO-FXiUU&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></center><br />

Enjoy this vid of our full ride of the <em><strong>It&#8217;s A Small World</strong></em> ride.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As September 02 draws evernear (get it?  <em>90210</em> premieres on 09.02 &#8230; well, <em>08</em> cuz 10 would take too long) the hype and anticipation for the new <em>90210</em> series on <strong>The CW</strong> also grows evermore &#8230; and to fan the flames of that anticipation just a bit, here are a whole slew of new promo pics of the principal cast of characters moving into Beverly Hills, 90210 this Fall:</p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_90210cast.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="372" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3142" /><br />
After the jump, check out individual cast photos of the <em>90210</em> kids and 3 of the adults (tho, none of the &#8220;special guest star&#8221; <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> alums) &#8230; <span id="more-3141"></span></p>
<p>The kids:</p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_90210kids.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="911" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3144" /><br />
Okay &#8230; can I get a big WTF? is going on with the pic of <strong>Tristan Wilds</strong>, the sole African-American cast member (who plays <strong>Dixon Mills</strong>) on the show &#8230; do you think they told him to pose like that?  Cuz, the first thing I thought of when I saw this pic was the signature fingerpoint pose made famous by <strong>Isaac</strong> the Bartender, the sole African-American castmember on <em>The Love Boat</em>.  Please tell me this wasn&#8217;t intentional!</p>
<p>The adults:</p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_90210adults.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3145" /><br />
I&#8217;m not entirely sure which characters are sleeping with which but I&#8217;m sure all will be revealed very soon.  It&#8217;s a pretty good looking cast &#8230; let&#8217;s see if they&#8217;re able to live up to the caliber of the original cast of kiddies from 90210.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Christian Bale</strong> and co. (made up of his wife <strong>Sibi</strong> and his daughter <strong>Emmeline</strong>) have returned home to SoCal after enduring a bit of a whirlwind tour of the world to promote <em>The Dark Knight</em> &#8230; here are a few pics of the somewhat haggard lookin&#8217; fam making their way thru <strong>LAX</strong> airport this week:</p>

I&#8217;m not entirely sure that <strong>Christian</strong> will have to jet off to far off places around the world anytime soon to do more promo work &#8230; I suspect he has to get back to the set of <em>Terminator: Salvation</em> in New Mexico to get back to work.  I dunno when or <em>if</em> the man sleeps but I am glad to know that he is tirelessly working towards bringing us great movies to watch.  Welcome home, <strong>Bale</strong>s.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong> is featured on the cover and in the pages of the new issue of <em>Details</em> magazine &#8230; and gave the magazine a boon of a selling opportunity by getting himself involved in a car accident (which was <a target="_blank" href="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/shia-labeouf-busted-again/" title="Shia LaBeouf Busted … Again!">initially reported as a DUI incident</a> and has <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20215599,00.html" title="Cops: Shia LaBeouf May Not Have Caused Crash">since been downgraded to the ruling that he wasn&#8217;t at fault at all</a>) mere moments before the mag hit newsstands &#8212; thereby ensuring a few more folks may prolly be inspired to pick up the mag than they might&#8217;ve been before his little crash-up, especially when they catch wind that he talks a bit about his penchant for enjoying spirited alcoholic drinks.  It&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://men.style.com/details/blogs/thegadabout/2008/07/shia-labeouf.html" title="SHIA LABEOUF'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT">the perfect coverstar at the perfect time talking about the perfect subject</a>.  Here is <strong>Shia</strong>&#8217;s cover and a portion of his <em>Details</em> interview that was conducted and covers incidents before this week&#8217;s accident &#8230; and I threw in a bit about his luck with the ladies cuz I just can&#8217;t see <strong>Shia</strong> scoring with chicks except for the fact that he&#8217;s a movie star:</p>
<p><img src="http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/073008_shiadetailsmag.jpg" alt="" title="" width="350" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3131" /><br />
<font color=white>&#8220;We would drink together and smoke together,&#8221; LaBeouf says, &#8220;and it&#8217;s just a bad deal. It&#8217;s not something that is conducive to being a role model—no iconic actors that I know of have problems like that. And I don&#8217;t know how to do it like a gentleman. I don&#8217;t know how to have one drink.&#8221;  If it sounds like an actor struggling to stay in character, it may be. &#8220;I mean, look, you get arrested, it&#8217;s out of control. There&#8217;s nothing &#8216;in control&#8217; about the situation,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as though things happen to me and I don&#8217;t say, never again.&#8221; But LaBeouf concedes that sticking to the straight-and-narrow is easier said than done. &#8220;I can never say never, because of where I&#8217;m at in my life and the vices that I&#8217;ve let go of,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But even when I was drinking, I never missed call times, ever.  So now it&#8217;s no more alcohol—just Parliament Lights. And women. LaBeouf deems his female situation &#8220;extraordinary,&#8221; though he refuses to discuss recent rumors tying him to Rihanna and the model Lauren Hastings. &#8220;I&#8217;m enjoying myself,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not great with women, dude. I&#8217;m not a closer. I can chat all night long, but I&#8217;m not the guy who goes, &#8216;Okay, back to my room.&#8217; I&#8217;ve never been that way—it&#8217;s not my presence, I just can&#8217;t do it. But it&#8217;s not been a priority of mine for a while. That aspect of my life is always going to be there. This&#8221;—his self-described &#8220;meteoric rise&#8221;—&#8221;is not always going to be here.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>HMMM &#8230; no more alcohol, eh?  We&#8217;ll see about that.  Even tho he may not have been at fault for this latest car accident (by ruling, anyways), it doesn&#8217;t really mean that he did no wrong.  The police took him into custody for <font color=white>&#8220;exhibiting outward signs of intoxication&#8221;</font> and I suspect he may exhibit such behavior in the future as well.  I kinda hope that he keeps his nose clean as best he can from here on out &#8230; all eyes are on him now.  Honestly, he doesn&#8217;t strike me as the kind of dude who learns lessons easily.  After the jump, check out one more photo of <strong>Shia</strong> in the new issue of <em>Details</em> magazine &#8230; <span id="more-3129"></span></p>

Yeah, I don&#8217;t really get the picture (at first, I thought he was ironing drapes but I now see that he&#8217;s holding his belt in his hand &#8230; while crouching over window treatments) but I figured it was worth posting &#8230; was I wrong?</p>

I love that <strong>Kanye</strong> even color-coordinates his attire to match his beverages &#8230; the pastel purple top goes nicely with his pink drink.  He is so fly.</p>
